A set of (mostly perl) scripts for manipulating tabular output from
NCBI Blast's blastall and blast+ suite of tools. 

See http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?CMD=Web&PAGE_TYPE=BlastNews#1
for more details about the NCBI Blast programs.

These scripts have come in very handy for filtering blast output, checking
how much of a query or reference sequence is covered by a blast hit, etc.
